# Meow.py
My first Shoot 'em up game and first program coded in Python. 
Experimented with the tkinter package to introduce myself into creating and manipulating GUIs with Python.

Before coding the game, I have set a list of features to implement for myself to follow. 
So that I can explore the different features of Tkinter as well as getting more experience with Python. 
As I've just started to pick it up as my second language after C#.

The list of features to be implemented:
  1. The use of images, shapes and texts.
  2. A scoring mechanism
  3. A leaderboard
  4. The movement of objects
  5. Allow user to move an object
  6. Collision detection between objects
  7. Pause and unpause
  8. Cheat codes (a sequence of keystrokes which triggers an event)
  9. Boss key
  
All these objectives have been fulfilled.
